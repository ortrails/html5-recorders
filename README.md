# html5

There are 2 folders:

1.	Html5
The HTML5 recorder that we received from TopCoder, that we are experimenting with in VR (virtualrecording.com). It has performance issues in that encoding an mp3 takes way too long.
2.	Lamejs-master
Sample application that has a faster mp3 encoder.

My plan was to rebuild #1 to incorporate the mp3 encoder from #2.  There are a couple of sample apps in #2 in the worker-example folder, index.html which demonstrates converting a wav file to mp3, and mic.html which demonstrates recording a live stream to mp3.
