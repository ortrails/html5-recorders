# html5

There are 3 folders:

1.	Html5-orig --
The original HTML5 recorder that we received from TopCoder, that we are experimenting with in VR (virtualrecording.com). It has performance issues in that encoding an mp3 takes way too long.
2. Html5-new --
Modified HTML5 recorder with same UI as #1 but with the faster mp3 encoder from #3.
3.	Lamejs-master --
Sample application that has a faster mp3 encoder.

There are a couple of sample apps in the #3 worker-example folder: index.html which demonstrates converting a wav file to mp3, and mic.html which demonstrates recording a live stream to mp3.
